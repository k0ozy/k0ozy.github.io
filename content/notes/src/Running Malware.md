### Launching DLLs 
```
rundll32.exe DLLname, Export arguments 
rundll32.exe rip.dll, Install
rundll32.exe xyzzy.dll, #5
```
* Export value must be a function name or ordinal selected from the exported function table in the DLL
* Malicious DLLs frequently run code in DLLMain. DLLMain is executed when the DLL is loaded. You can get information by forcing the DLL to load using rundll32.exe 

#### Modifying the PE header
* You can turn a DLL into an executable by modifying the PE header and forcing Windows to load as exe
* Wipe the IMAGE_FILE_DLL (0x2000) flag in IMAGE_FILE_HEADER

#### Installing as a Service 
```
rundll32 ipr32x.dll,InstallService ServiceName
net start ServiceName
```

>[!note] 
>When you see a ServiceMain function without Install or InstallService, you may need to install manually. This can be done with sc or by modifying the registry and using net start. Service entries are located at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.
